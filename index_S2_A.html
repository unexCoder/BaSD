                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>“I always imagined when I came to the <a href="index_S2_B.html">Royal Albert Hall</a>  
                        that I was going  to do everything perfect, no f***in’ around,” says 
                        Patti Smith, icon of American punk, after mangling the intro to 
                        “My Blakean Year”.</p>
    
                    <p>But even an imperfect Smith is a brilliant Smith, as illustrated by her performance 
                        of <a href="index_S2_B.html">Bob Dylan</a>’s “A Hard Rain’s Gonna Fall” at 
                        the 2016 Nobel prize ceremony in Sweden, when she forgot the lyrics and 
                        had to start again. Her second attempt reduced the room to tears and 
                        subsequently went viral.</p>
                                
                    <p>Smith remains a reluctant rock star – she calls herself a writer rather 
                        than musician, in tribute to those she believes do the latter job better 
                        than her. Yet, at 74, she is one of the most visceral and charismatic 
                        performers out there.</p>
                                    
                    <p>Her two nights at the Albert Hall, with a band that includes her son, 
                        Jackson Smith, and long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, were originally 
                        scheduled for spring 2020, before the pandemic brought live music to a halt.</p>
                                        
                    <p>This evening she hails the patience and optimism of those who held on to their 
                        tickets, earnestly dedicating the 2000 song “Grateful” to them. <br>
                        Smith’s setlist hopscotches across the years, drawing on her vast and 
                        varied catalogue and occasionally dipping into other people’s – there 
                        are covers of Stevie Wonder’s “Blame It On The Sun” and Dylan’s “One Too 
                        Many Mornings”.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Over two hours, Smith seamlessly morphs between rock goddess, 
                        incantatory shaman and … comedian? When someone yelps “I love you, 
                        Patti!” she drawls, “I’m not available.” Another fan raises the 
                        subject of her now-fabled love of British detective dramas such as 
                        <a href="index_S2_B.html">Inspector George Gently</a>, 
                        <a href="index_S2_B.html">Morse</a> and 
                        <a href="index_S2_B.html">Midsomer Murders</a>.</p>
                        
                    <p>Smith confirms she loves them all before launching into an improvised 
                        ode to her favourite television network – “When I’m home in NYC, I 
                        think only of you ITV3”.</p>
                    <p>Horses, Smith’s landmark album from 1975 which fused punk and poetry, 
                        looms large, with “Land: Horses/Land of a Thousand Dances” merging 
                        exquisitely with “Gloria (In Excelsis Deo)”, with the unforgettable 
                        line “Jesus died for somebody’s sins but not mine.” These songs sound 
                        as hypnotic and transgressive as they did 45 years ago.</p>
                    <p>Elsewhere, “Free Money” reminds you that, for all her poetic rapture, 
                        Smith can crank out a rock banger when the mood takes her. Similarly 
                        raucous and joyful is 1978’s “Because The Night”, for which the lights 
                        are turned up to reveal a crowd on their feet and punching the air.</p>
                    <p>Smith’s sense of wonder at being back on stage and communing with the 
                        faithful rarely leaves her face, her energy undimmed after nearly two 
                        years confined to her home.</p>
                    <p>A reluctant rock star she may be, but it’s good to have her back.</p>
