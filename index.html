                <p>Facebook’s <a href="to_link.html">mass outage that pushed its major services 
                    offline</a> was caused by an engineer error made during routine maintenance 
                    of its network of data centres.</p>
                <p>Santosh Janardhan, <a href="to_link.html">Facebook’s</a> vice-president of engineering explained that 
                    Monday’s outage was triggered by a command that was issued to assess the 
                    availability of the company’s global backbone capacity – the network it has 
                    built to link all its computing facilities together.</p>
                <p><a href="to_link.html">Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger were offline globally for around 
                    six hours</a>, preventing billions of people across the world from accessing 
                    their accounts.</p>
                <p>“This outage was triggered by the system that manages our global backbone 
                    network capacity,” Mr Janardhan <a href="to_link.html">wrote</a>. “The backbone is the network Facebook 
                    has built to connect all our computing facilities together, which consists of 
                    tens of thousands of miles of fibre-optic cables crossing the globe and linking 
                    all our data centres.</p>
                <p>“During one of these routine maintenance jobs, a command was issued with the 
                    intention to assess the availability of global backbone capacity, which 
                    unintentionally took down all the connections in our backbone network, 
                    effectively disconnecting Facebook data centres globally,”</p>
                <p>While the company’s systems are designed to audit commands to prevent 
                    mistakes, a bug in the audit tool prevented it from properly stopping the 
                    command, he explained.</p>
                <p>Facebook sent engineers to their onsite data centres to attempt to debug the 
                    problem and restart the systems but were hampered by the high degree of 
                    physical and system security.</p>
                <p>Once the engineers finally confirmed the issue and brought the backbone back 
                    online, the engineers had to be cautious to avoid overloading the systems 
                    with a colossal surge in traffic</p>
                <p>Experience from extensive ‘storm drills’ meant Facebook was confident it could 
                    restore the systems and bring the services back online “relatively quickly”, 
                    Mr Janardhan continued.</p>
                <p>“Every failure like this is an opportunity to learn and get better, and there’s 
                    plenty for us to learn from this one,” he added.</p>
                <p>“From here on out, our job is to strengthen our testing, drills, and overall 
                    resilience to make sure events like this happen as rarely as possible.”</p>
                <p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said the outage had been a 
                    “reminder of how much our work matters to people”.</p>
                <p>“The deeper concern with an outage like this isn’t how many people switch to 
                    competitive services or how much money we lose, but what it means for the people 
                    who rely on our services to communicate with loved ones, run their businesses, or 
                    support their communities,” he said in a <a href="to_link.html">note to staff</a> shared publicly on Facebook.</p>
                <p>The outage occurred during a difficult time for Facebook, which has been under intense 
                    scrutiny following a series of revelations about the <a href="to_link.html">research it had conducted into 
                        the negative effect of Instagram on young users’ mental health</a>.</p>
                <p>Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen made global headlines on Tuesday when she told 
                    US Congress that <a href="to_link.html">millions more teenagers may be addicted to Instagram than is known 
                        or currently understood</a>  as part of a hearing into child safety online.</p>
                <p>Many of the company’s internal research reports indicated that Facebook has a “serious 
                    negative harm on a significant portion of teenagers and children,” <a href="to_link.html">Ms Haugen</a> told 
                    Congress, adding that its amplification algorithms can lead children from innocuous 
                    topics such as healthy recipes to content that promotes anorexia “over a very short 
                    period of time”.</p>    
                <p><a href="to_link.html">Mr Zuckerberg</a> accused a Ms Haugen of painting a false picture of the company, adding that 
                    many of her claims “don’t make sense”.</p>    
                <p>“At the heart of these accusations is this idea that we prioritise profit over safety 
                    and well-being. That’s just not true,” he said.</p>    
                <p>“I’m sure many of you have found the recent coverage hard to read because it just doesn’t 
                    reflect the company we know. We care deeply about issues like safety, well-being and 
                    mental health. It’s difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our 
                    motives. At the most basic level, I think most of us just don’t recognize the false 
                    picture of the company that is being painted.”</p>    
                <p>“I know it’s frustrating to see the good work we do get mischaracterized, especially 
                    for those of you who are making important contributions across safety, integrity, 
                    research and product. But I believe that over the long term if we keep trying to do 
                    what’s right and delivering experiences that improve people’s lives, it will be better 
                    for our community and our business.”</p>
